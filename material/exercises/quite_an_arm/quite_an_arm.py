A stone is thrown from the top of a building at an angle of 30.0ยบ to the horizontal and with an initial speed of 20.0 ms, as in the following figure.
[A] If the height of the building is 45.0m, how long is the stone "in flight"?
[B] What is the speed of the stone just before it strikes the ground?
